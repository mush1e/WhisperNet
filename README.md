# WhisperNet

WhisperNet is a decentralized, anonymous file-sharing and chat application that prioritizes user privacy and security. With direct peer-to-peer interactions, users can create unique identities, manage chatrooms, and share files without a central authority, fostering a community-driven environment for secure communication.

## Features

- **Decentralized Authentication**: Unique usernames linked to Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) with public-private key pairs.
- **Peer-to-Peer Networking**: Direct, encrypted communication using advanced P2P protocols.
- **Anonymous Chatrooms**: Create and manage chatrooms with customizable privacy settings.
- **Secure File Sharing**: Upload and share files using decentralized storage solutions (e.g., IPFS).

## Technologies Used

- C++
- OpenSSL / libsodium for cryptography
- libp2p / WebRTC for P2P networking
- IPFS for file storage
